# ABOUT ME

I am a Junior Quality Assurance Engineer.
My interest in software testing comes from my conviction
that it is important to test in order to create high-quality
products and from my strengths, such as the ability to
analyze and problem solving, attention to detail, and
communication skills.

I am motivated by the prospect of discovering new
technologies, methodologies, and testing techniques to
sharpen my skills. Expanding my knowledge base and
working with a team of like minded individuals where
ideas are shared, challenges are tackled collectively, and
successes are celebrated together

# <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

I am a Junior Quality Assurance Engineer. My interest in software testing comes from my conviction that it is important to test in order to create high-quality products and from my strengths, such as the ability to analyze and problem solving, attention to detail, and communication skills.

I have basic knowledge and practical experience in testing SQL, API, HTML, XML, JSON. I have practiced extensively using tools such Testrail, Jira, Qase, Trello, DBeaver, Postman and DevTools. Currently I continue expanding my knowledge into Automation testing.

I am motivated by the prospect of discovering new technologies, methodologies, and testing techniques to sharpen my skills. Expanding my knowledge base and working with a team of like minded individuals where ideas are shared, challenges are tackled collectively, and successes are celebrated together
